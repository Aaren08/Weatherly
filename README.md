In order to play the videos yourself, head over to pexels.com website and download videos based on the description given in the src/components/weather/weatherVideo.jsx file and rename the files exactly as they are given in the file with .mp4 video extension. Or, if you want you can also modify the code to use video links directly from pexels.com website without having to download them separately.

Hope this helps!
